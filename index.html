  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Ron Zlatin, combining my passion for software QA with a love for travel and exploration.  
    As a QA tester in training, I focus on manual testing, bug reporting, and writing detailed test scenarios.  
    My journey into quality assurance is fueled by curiosity, ambition, and a desire to deliver flawless user experiences.  
    I enjoy working with tools like Selenium and SQL, constantly improving my skills with hands-on practice.  
    Traveling helps me see different cultures, sharpen my observational skills, and inspire new perspectives.  
    From bustling cities to quiet landscapes, I capture photos that tell stories and preserve memories.  
    I believe that detailed QA work and photography both require patience, precision, and passion.<br><br>
